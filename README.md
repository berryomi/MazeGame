# Maze Game

A command line game where the player becomes a mouse who wants to escape the maze.

## Game Description

The player's goal is to control a mouse while collecting a certain number of cheeses to win the game. At the same time, several blind cats are wandering around the maze who will eat the mouse. If the mouse and the cat ever occupy the same cell, the player loses the game.
